The web-based application will provide interfaces for handling tickets with notes and solutions, full-text search indexing, and allowing for plug-ins which can generate tickets from external sources (i.e. Asterisk, OpenNMS, Nagios, IMAP, POP3, etc..).

Since the application is written in Java, it will run on any platform that is supported for Java application servers. The initial development is being done on Linux, using the Eclipse development environment.
