# How To Join The Project #

First, I recommend you join our mailing list. You can do that by going to the Google Groups page [HERE](http://groups.google.com/group/triage-devel).

Second, download the source code and fire it up in <a href='http://www.eclipse.org'>Eclipse</a>. You will probably want to have the ZK Studio plug-in for Eclipse from <a href='http://www.zkoss.org'>ZKOSS.org</a>.

Next, if you see a part of the application you want to contribute to, write some code and post the <a href='http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/howtos/DiffPatch.html'>patch</a> to the mailing list with an explanation as to what it is. If your contributions are valuable, you will be given direct commit access on the Subversion tree.

If you don't program, but would still like to help, right now that is not possible; BUT, check back soon because there will be translation projects and theming projects down the road.

Thanks, and have good one!!
